[c/ff9eb4:One Skyblock Challenge] is a mod based on the Skyblock survival mode concept with only one starting block in the entire map which can be repeatedly mined for resources.

[c/ff9eb4:Mods are recommended] for a complete playthrough. Please make sure to create a new world (small) for a proper skyblock experience. The Dungeon and Temple are currently enabled by default. This can be changed in the config. If world generation is stuck, try restarting the game or disable structures.
